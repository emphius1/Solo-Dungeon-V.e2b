# Cloud Hosting Setup for D&D AI-Driven Experience

## Overview
This document outlines the steps for setting up cloud hosting for the D&D AI-Driven single-player experience, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.

## Hosting Provider
We have chosen AWS as our cloud hosting provider due to its extensive services and support for Docker containerization.

## AWS Services Utilized
- **EC2**: For running our Docker containers.
- **RDS**: For PostgreSQL database hosting.
- **S3**: For storing static files and wireframes.
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: For simplified deployment and scaling.
- **IAM**: For managing access to AWS services securely.

## Steps for Setup

### 1. AWS Account Setup
Ensure that an AWS account is created and that you have access to the AWS Management Console.

### 2. IAM Configuration
Create a new IAM user with programmatic access and assign necessary permissions for EC2, RDS, and S3 services.

### 3. EC2 Instance Creation
Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console:
- Choose an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.medium).
- Configure the instance details, ensuring it's within the correct VPC.
- Add storage as required.
- Tag the instance with a name, such as `DnDGameServer`.
- Configure the Security Group to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic.
- Review and launch the instance, and then connect to it using SSH.

### 4. RDS Database Setup
Set up an RDS instance for PostgreSQL:
- Select the PostgreSQL engine.
- Choose a template that suits the project's needs.
- Specify DB instance details, including instance class and storage.
- Set up the DB settings, including the username and password.
- Configure the network and security, ensuring it's accessible from the EC2 instance.
- Launch the RDS instance.

### 5. S3 Bucket Configuration
Create an S3 bucket for storing static assets:
- Name the bucket (e.g., `dndgame-assets`).
- Configure the permissions to allow public read access for static files.
- Enable versioning and logging as needed.

### 6. Elastic Beanstalk Environment Setup
Set up an Elastic Beanstalk application and environment:
- Create a new application named `DnDGameApp`.
- Choose the Docker platform and upload the Dockerfile or use the preconfigured Docker runtimes.
- Configure the environment to link to the RDS instance and S3 bucket.
- Launch the environment.

### 7. Deployment
Deploy the application:
- Use the Elastic Beanstalk CLI or AWS Management Console to deploy the application.
- Upload the ZIP file containing the application code and Dockerfile.
- Monitor the deployment status and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

### 8. DNS Configuration
Configure a domain name using Route 53:
- Register a domain name (e.g., `dndgameai.com`).
- Create a hosted zone for the domain.
- Update the DNS records to point to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### 9. SSL/TLS Certificate
Request an SSL/TLS certificate using AWS Certificate Manager:
- Validate the domain ownership.
- Once issued, configure the Elastic Beanstalk load balancer to use the SSL/TLS certificate.

### 10. Monitoring and Logging
Set up CloudWatch for monitoring and logging:
- Configure alarms for high CPU usage, high memory usage, and any other relevant metrics.
- Set up logging to track access and error logs.

## Scalability Considerations
- Utilize Auto Scaling groups to handle varying loads.
- Monitor RDS performance and scale the instance type or read replicas as needed.

## Security Measures
- Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- Regularly update IAM roles and policies to follow the principle of least privilege.
- Secure the database with security groups and IAM roles.

## Backup and Recovery
- Enable automated backups for RDS.
- Regularly backup the EC2 instance and S3 bucket data.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will set up a robust cloud hosting environment for the D&D AI-Driven single-player experience, adhering to the project's ideals and ensuring a secure, scalable, and reliable platform.
