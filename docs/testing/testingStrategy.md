# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the AI-driven single-player D&D experience application. The strategy covers various testing methods to ensure the application is robust, secure, and provides a seamless user experience.

## Unit Testing
### Frontend
- Test each React component in isolation using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Mock external dependencies using Jest to test components that interact with the backend or APIs.
- Validate UI elements render correctly with given props.
- Ensure that state changes and event handlers function as expected.

### Backend
- Use PyTest to test individual functions and classes in the Django application.
- Mock database interactions to test the game logic without the need for a live database.
- Validate that the game state updates correctly after each action.

### GPT Assistants and GPT-4-1106-preview Integration
- Mock API responses to test the integration with OpenAI's APIs.
- Ensure that the assistants and GPT-4-1106-preview handle subtasks correctly and return expected results.

## Integration Testing
- Test the interaction between frontend components and the backend using Cypress.
- Validate the RESTful API endpoints with Postman, ensuring they handle requests and responses correctly.
- Test the integration of the frontend with the Assistant APIs and GPT-4-1106-preview API.

## End-to-End Testing
- Automate user flows from character creation to gameplay using Selenium or Cypress.
- Simulate a complete game session to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Performance Testing
- Use tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to assess the frontend performance.
- Conduct stress testing on the backend to evaluate its performance under heavy load.

## Security Testing
- Perform static code analysis using tools like SonarQube to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- Test for common security threats such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

## Accessibility Testing
- Use automated tools like axe-core to test for accessibility compliance.
- Conduct manual testing to ensure the application is usable by people with various disabilities.

## User Acceptance Testing
- Gather feedback from a group of beta testers representing a cross-section of the target audience.
- Incorporate feedback into the development process to refine the user experience.

## Test Automation
- Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Automate the deployment of test environments using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Test Coverage
- Aim for a high level of test coverage, but prioritize critical paths and functionalities.
- Use coverage tools like Istanbul for JavaScript and Coverage.py for Python to track coverage metrics.

## Testing Tools
- Jest, React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- PyTest for backend unit tests.
- Cypress and Postman for integration tests.
- Selenium or Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- Lighthouse, WebPageTest for performance tests.
- SonarQube for security testing.
- axe-core for accessibility testing.
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions for test automation.
- Istanbul, Coverage.py for test coverage analysis.

## Reporting and Documentation
- Generate test reports after each test run to document successes and failures.
- Maintain a test log to track the history of test cases and their results.

## Conclusion
This testing strategy ensures that the application meets the high standards set out in the project's ideals. By rigorously testing each component and their interactions, we aim to deliver a reliable and engaging D&D experience.
