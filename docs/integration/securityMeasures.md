# Security Measures

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the D&D AI-driven single-player experience to protect user data and ensure secure communication between the frontend, backend, and integrated APIs.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Utilize OAuth 2.0 for secure API access.
- Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for maintaining user session integrity.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict system access based on user roles.

## Data Transmission
- All data transmitted over the network is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
- API endpoints, including `assistantsEndpoint` and `chatCompletionsEndpoint`, enforce HTTPS to prevent data interception.

## Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs on the frontend to prevent XSS attacks.
- Validate and sanitize data on the backend before processing to prevent SQL injection, especially in `postgresqlAdapter.py` and `mongodbAdapter.py`.

## Database Security
- Use parameterized queries in `postgresqlAdapter.py` and `mongodbAdapter.py` to avoid SQL injection.
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database using AES-256 encryption.
- Regularly back up the database and store backups in a secure location.

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling to prevent leakage of stack traces or sensitive information to the user.
- Log errors internally for review by the Quality Assurance Officer Assistant.

## API Security
- Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse.
- Use API keys and secret tokens to authenticate third-party services like OpenAI's APIs.
- Store API keys and secrets in environment variables, not in the codebase.

## Code Security
- Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
- Use static code analysis tools to automatically detect potential security issues.

## Infrastructure Security
- Host the application on secure cloud platforms with built-in security features.
- Use firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor for malicious activity.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Set up monitoring and alerting for any unusual activity that could indicate a security breach.
- Regularly update all dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response Plan
- Develop an incident response plan detailing steps to take in the event of a security breach.
- Train staff on incident response procedures to ensure quick and effective action.

## Compliance
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
- Conduct periodic security audits to maintain compliance standards.

## Conclusion
Adhering to these security measures will help safeguard the application against common security threats and ensure the protection of user data and system integrity.
