# Frontend-Backend Integration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for integrating the frontend and backend components of our single-player D&D experience application. The integration will ensure seamless communication between the React-based frontend and the Django-based backend, including interactions with OpenAI's APIs.

## Data Exchange Protocols

### RESTful API Communication

- The frontend will communicate with the backend through RESTful APIs designed in `backend/api/restfulAPI.py`.
- JSON will be the primary data exchange format for sending and receiving data.
- The frontend will use the `fetch` API to make asynchronous requests to the backend.

### Real-Time Data Updates

- For real-time updates, such as combat states or NPC interactions, we will use WebSockets to establish a persistent connection between the client and server.
- The Django Channels library will be used to handle WebSocket connections on the backend.

## API Calls

### Character Creation and Management

- The frontend will call `createCharacter()` and `updateCharacter()` functions, which will send POST and PUT requests to the `/characters` endpoint defined in `restfulAPI.py`.

### Game Interface Elements

- Combat actions will be managed by calling `handleCombat()` which sends requests to the `/combat` endpoint.
- Quest updates will be sent through `logQuest()` to the `/quests` endpoint.
- Map interactions will be handled by `displayMap()` with requests to the `/map` endpoint.
- Journal entries will be added via `addJournalEntry()` to the `/journal` endpoint.
- Bestiary access will be managed by `accessBestiary()` with requests to the `/bestiary` endpoint.
- NPC relationships will be updated through `manageNPCRelationships()` with requests to the `/npcs` endpoint.

## Security Measures

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for secure authentication and authorization.
- The frontend will store the token securely and include it in the Authorization header of each request.

### Data Validation

- Frontend inputs will be validated using React's state management before sending to the backend.
- The backend will perform additional validation before processing requests to ensure data integrity.

### HTTPS

- All data exchanges will be conducted over HTTPS to ensure encryption of data in transit.

## Error Handling

- The frontend will implement error handling to catch and display user-friendly error messages based on the HTTP status codes returned by the backend.
- The backend will use Django's built-in exception handling to return appropriate error responses.

## Testing Integration

- Integration tests will be written to test API endpoints using tools like Postman and Jest for the frontend.
- Automated tests will be set up to run on every pull request to the main branch to ensure integration points do not break with new changes.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- A CI/CD pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes.
- The `dockerContainerizationStrategy.md` document outlines the container setup for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Application performance and errors will be monitored using tools like Sentry for the backend and React Monitoring for the frontend.
- Logs will be collected and analyzed to identify and address issues proactively.

## Conclusion

This integration strategy ensures that the frontend and backend components of our application work together harmoniously, providing a seamless and secure user experience. By adhering to this strategy, we maintain the project's ideals and deliver on our vision of a unique, AI-driven single-player D&D experience.
